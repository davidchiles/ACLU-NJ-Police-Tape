		<h2>If You're Detained or Under Arrest</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>
			You have the right to remain silent and to talk to a 
			lawyer before you talk to the police. Tell the police 
			nothing except your name and address. Don't give any 
			explanations, excuses or stories. You can make your
			defense later, in court, based on what you and your
			lawyer decide is best.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ask to see a lawyer immediately. If you can't pay for a 
			lawyer, you have a right to a free one, and should ask the 
			police how the lawyer can be contacted. Donâ€™t say anything without a lawyer. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Within a reasonable time after your arrest, or booking, you have the right to make a local phone call: to a 
			lawyer, bail bondsman, a relative or any other person. 
			The police may not listen to the call to the lawyer.
		</li>
		<li>
            Sometimes you can be released without bail, or have
			bail lowered. Have your lawyer ask the judge about this
			possibility. You must be taken before the judge on the 
			next court day after arrest.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not make any decisions in your case until you have 
			talked with a lawyer.
        </li>
