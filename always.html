		<h2>Always</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>
			Remain calm. Don't run or flee. Think about your words, movement, body language and emotions.
		</li>
		<li>
			Don't argue, swear, or threaten a complaint. Anything you say or do can be used against you.
		</li>
		<li>
			Speak carefully. It's not illegal to decline to answer questions, but bad-mouthing an officer isn't helpful.
		</li>
		<li>
			Keep your hands where officers can see them.
		</li>
		<li>
			Don't touch any police officer.
		</li>
		<li>
			Don't resist, even if you think you're innocent.
		</li>
		<li>
			Don't make statements about the incident.
		</li>
		<li>
			Never interfere with or obstruct police - you can be arrested for it.
		</li>
		</ul>
