		<h2>If You're Stopped In Your Car</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>
			Upon request, show them your driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance. In certain cases, your car 
			can be searched without a warrant as long as the police 
			have probable cause. To protect yourself later, you
			should make it clear that you do not consent to a search. 
			It is not lawful for police to arrest you simply for refusing 
			to consent to a search.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you're suspected of drunk driving (DWI) and refuse 
			to take a blood, urine or breath test, your driver's license 
			may be suspended. 
		</li>
		</ul>
