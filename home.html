		<h2>If Police Come to Your Home</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>
			If the police knock and ask to enter your home, you
			don't have to admit them unless they have a warrant
			signed by a judge.
		</li>
		<li>
			However, in some emergency situations (like when a 
			person is screaming for help inside, or when the police 
			are chasing someone) officers are allowed to enter and 
			search your home without a warrant. 
		</li>
		<li>
			If you are arrested, the police can search you and the 
			area close by. If you are in a building, "close by" usually 
			means just the room you are in.
		</li>
		</ul>
