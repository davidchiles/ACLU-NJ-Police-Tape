		<h2>Handling Police Contact on the Street</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>
			It's not a crime to refuse to answer questions, but
			refusing to answer might make the police suspicious
			about you.
		</li>
		<li>
			You must show your driver's license and registration 
			when stopped in a car. Otherwise, you don't have to
			answer any questions if you are detained or arrested, 
			with one important exception. The police may ask for 
			your name if you have been properly detained, and you 
			can be arrested in some states for refusing to give it. If 
			you reasonably fear that your name is incriminating, you 
			can claim the right to remain silent, which may be a 
			defense in case you are arrested anyway.
		</li>
		<li>
			Police may "pat-down" your clothing if they suspect a 
			concealed weapon. Don't physically resist, but make it 
			clear that you don't consent to any further search.
		</li>
		<li>
            Ask if you are under arrest. If you are, you have a right 
			to know why.
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't bad-mouth the police officer or run away, even 
			if you believe what is happening is unreasonable. That 
			could lead to your arrest. 
        </li>
        <li>
            What you say to the police is always important. What 
			you say can be used against you, and it can give the police 
			an excuse to arrest you, especially if you badmouth a 
			police officer.
        </li>
        <li>
            You must show your driver's license and registration 
			when stopped in a car. Otherwise, you don't have to

        </li>
        <li>
            You DO NOT have to consent to any search of yourself, 
			your car or your house. If you DO consent to a search, it 
			can affect your rights later in court. If the police say they 
			have a search warrant, ASK TO SEE IT.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not interfere with, or obstruct the police &mdash; you
			can be arrested for it. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Think carefully about your words, movement, body 
			language, and emotions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't get into an argument with the police. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Remember, anything you say or do can be used 
			against you.
        </li>
        <li>
            Keep your hands where the police can see them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't run. Don't touch any police officer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't resist even if you believe you are innocent. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't complain on the scene or tell the police they're 
			wrong or that you're going to file a complaint.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not make any statements regarding the incident. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Ask for a lawyer immediately upon your arrest. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Remember officers' badge and patrol car numbers. 
        </li>
        <li>
             Write down everything you remember ASAP.
        </li>
        <li>
            Try to find witnesses, their names and phone numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are injured, take photographs of the injuries as 
			soon as possible, but make sure you seek medical 
			attention first.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you feel your rights have been violated, file a written 
			complaint with the police department's internal affairs 
			division, visit <a href="http://www.aclu-nj.org/profiling">www.aclu-nj.org/profiling</a>
        </li>
